Instructions for running the app:

Open SQL Server and run the script in the "script" attachment on a new query page.
Then open Visual Studio and run the attached project folder there.
At the same time, open the VS Code workspace and run the attached folder named "IonicProject", using the terminal.
The run command is ionic serve

Good luck!!

I uploaded the whole project again safely. Now the run should be simple and normal *
